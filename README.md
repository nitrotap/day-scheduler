# Day Scheduler

This project uses Bootstrap and jQuery to function as a single day scheduler.


GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule   
WHEN I open the planner   
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar   
WHEN I scroll down   
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours   
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day   
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or    
WHEN I click into a time block   
THEN I can enter an event   
WHEN I click the save button for that time block   
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage   
WHEN I refresh the page   
THEN the saved events persist
